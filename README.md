# CIFAR-Classification
The goal of this project is to classify the images of a smaller version of CIFAR-100 dataset, which is limited to images from 10 different categories, [the CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

In [the first part of this project](https://github.com/tanya-jp/CIFAR-Classification/blob/main/CIFAR_ANN.ipynb), an `ANN` has been implemented, and in [the second part](https://github.com/tanya-jp/CIFAR-Classification/blob/main/CIFAR_CNN_.ipynb), a `CNN` has been built in `Keras`, using `TensorFlow`.
- All information and descriptions about the network and dataset are available in .ipynb files.
